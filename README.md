# The Generic Mapping Tools for Geodesy

Material for the 2020 UNAVCO Short Course.

**Instructors:**
[Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/),
[Joaquim Luis](http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/),
[Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com),

**Assistants:**
Brook Tozer [GNI New Zealand], Lauren Ward and Andrew Chase [UH Manoa]

**When [DRAFT]**:
July 20-21 (Monday-Tuesday), 2020.
7:00 - 12:30 Hawaii
10:00 - 15:30 US Pacific Coast
13:00 - 18:30 US East Coast
19:00 - 00:30 London

**Where**:
On-line via zoom

**Planning**:
Participants must **have their own computers** (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the
required **software already installed** (see [Installing](#installing) below).

This 2-day course will cover the use of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) in geodesy
using UNIX shell scripting. Lectures and exercises will be given to teach the
basic conventions of using GMT, such as plotting grids, images, and vector data
(points, lines, polygons). Labs will include both processing and mapping of
various data sets relevant to geodesy.

## Installing

Participants will need to install some software for the workshop.
Please follow
[these instructions](INSTALL.md)
**before the workshop**.

## Need help?

If you have any trouble installing or questions about the course/homeworks,
there are a few ways to ask for help:

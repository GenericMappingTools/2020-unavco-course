# The Generic Mapping Tools for Geodesy

Material for the 2020 UNAVCO Short Course.

**Instructors:**
[Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/),
[Joaquim Luis](http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/),
[Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com),
[Dongdong Tian](https://msu.edu/~tiandong/),
[Xiaohua Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaohua_Xu7)

**Assistants:**
Brook Tozer [GNS New Zealand], Lauren Ward and Andrew Chase [UH Manoa]

**When [DRAFT]**:
July 20-21 (Monday-Tuesday), 2020., 1700-2200 UTC
07:00 - 12:00 Hawaii
10:00 - 15:00 US Pacific Coast
13:00 - 18:00 US East Coast
18:00 - 23:00 London

**Where**:
On-line via zoom

**Planning**:
Participants must **have their own computers** (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the
required **software already installed** (see [Installing](#installing) below).

This 2-day course will cover the use of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) in geodesy
using UNIX shell scripting. Lectures and exercises will be given to teach the
basic conventions of using GMT, such as plotting grids, images, and vector data
(points, lines, polygons). Labs will include both processing and mapping of
various data sets relevant to geodesy.

## Installing

Participants will need to install some software for the workshop.
Please follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md) **before the workshop**.

## Need help?

If you have any trouble installing or questions about the course/homeworks,
there are a few ways to ask for help:

* Open an *Issue* on this repository by
  [clicking here](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/2020-unavco-course/issues/new/choose).
  You'll need a GitHub account to do this.
* Post to the [GMT Community Forum](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/)

## Video, Slides and Notes

The workshop video recording, slides and shared notes will be available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Vp8jKZJZnxJnBwiMtmEWw_G1DPr9CwSi).

## Schedule

Please make sure you know the local time for the sessions!  Use the [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) and compare UTC to your time zone.

## Communication During the Course

We will use the Slack workspace, the Zoom Chat window, and the GitHub Issue Tracker to help you during the course:
1. During a *presentation*, the other instructors will monitor the Slack workspace as well as the Chat room and answer any questions.
2. During a *breakout session* you will be working on scripting.  If you get stuck, make a new issue on GitHub so that an instructor
   can help you.  You can post a description of the problem, your script or failing command, any error messages and any outputs or plots within the issue.
   Once resolved we will close that issue.
